### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In the given project, we apply descriptive statistics using Pyhton's libraries numpy and pandas, to filter information about 
company Bikeshare's operrations in three chities - Chicago, New York City and Washington. The filters information applied according to the 
user input to find out information city-wise. The data is filtered according to either of the three:
(a) The city
(b) The month
(c) The month and the day of the week 
Additionlly, the user can opt to leave out the month and day of the week filters.

Prior to applying the filters (a) or (b), the user also has the option to see the raw data of the chosen city(five lines at a time), This is handled by aseprate function.

After filtering, application of descriptive statistics yields information like:
(1) Most time of tavel
(2) Most popular stations
(3) Total and avgerage trip duration
(4) Statistics related to users (user type,gender, year of birth) 


All the functions have been timed using the time library.

Prior to applying the filters (a) or (b), the user also has the option to see the raw data of the chosen city(five lines at a time). This is handled by a separate function.

After filtering, application of descriptive statistics yields information like:
(1) The most frequent times of travel (month(s), day(s), hour(s)) in the city
(2) The most popular stations and trips in the city
(3) The total and average trip duration for the city
(4) Statistics related to users (user type, gender, year of birth)
All the functions have been timed using the time library.
